          <h1>about me</h1>
          <h2>meet your expert web developer</h2>
          <p>Hello! I’m Michael Humphrey, a passionate frontend web developer with a mission to help businesses all around the world create beautiful, functional websites that drive success. My expertise lies in crafting clean, modern, and mobile-responsive websites that empower businesses to connect with their customers, build trust, and grow.</p>
          <p>With over a year of experience in frontend development, I’ve had the privilege of working with a diverse range of businesses from small local shops to global enterprises. I specialize in using the latest web technologies, such as HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and frameworks like React and Vue, to build websites that are not only visually appealing but also perform exceptionally well on all devices.</p>
          <h2>My Journey</h2>
          <p>I started my career in web development after discovering my passion for technology and design. What began as a hobby creating personal websites and experimenting with code soon turned into a full-fledged career. Over the years, I’ve honed my skills, built a solid portfolio, and worked on projects that span industries, such as healthcare, education, retail, fitness, and more.</p>
          <p>Throughout my journey, I've learned that the most important aspect of web development isn’t just writing code it’s understanding the needs of the business and the end users. A website is a tool for connecting with your audience, and I believe every website should be designed with that connection in mind.</p>
          <h2>Why I Do What I Do</h2>
          <p>I’m driven by the belief that every business, no matter how big or small, deserves a professional online presence. Too often, I’ve seen businesses struggle to build websites that reflect their brand and values, or worse, avoid having a website altogether. I’m here to change that.</p>
          <p>As someone who has worked with both large corporations and small businesses, I understand that each project has unique needs. I pride myself on offering custom solutions that are tailored to each client, ensuring that the final product not only meets but exceeds their expectations.</p>
          <p>My goal is to make web development easy and accessible. I work closely with my clients throughout the entire process, from the initial consultation all the way through to the final product, and beyond. Whether you’re a startup or an established brand, I’ll take the time to understand your vision and deliver a website that aligns with your goals.</p>
          <h2>What I Value</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Simplicity:</strong> I believe in clean, simple, and intuitive design that makes it easy for your customers to interact with your site. A website should never overwhelm or confuse its users—it should work seamlessly.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Collaboration:</strong> Building a website is a collaborative effort. I make it a priority to understand your business, goals, and challenges so that the solution we create is perfectly aligned with your needs.</li>
            <li><strong>Affordability:</strong> Many businesses assume that creating a website is too expensive, but that doesn’t have to be the case. I offer cost-effective packages designed for businesses of all sizes, ensuring that you can have a high-quality website without breaking the bank.</li>
            <li><strong>Transparency:</strong> From the start, I’ll give you a clear idea of the project timeline, costs, and deliverables. There are no hidden fees or surprises</li>
            <li><strong>Ongoing Support:</strong> My commitment doesn’t end once the website is live. I offer ongoing support and maintenance to ensure your site remains secure, up-to-date, and performs optimally at all times.</li>
          </ul>
          <h2>Technologies I Work With</h2>
          <p>To build robust, scalable, and future-proof websites, I use the latest web technologies and frameworks, including:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>HTML5:</strong> For creating structured, semantic web pages</li>
            <li><strong>CSS3:</strong> To create stylish, responsive, and visually appealing layouts.</li>
            <li><strong>JavaScript:</strong> For adding interactivity and dynamic features.</li>
            <li><strong>React and Vue:</strong> Modern frontend frameworks for building fast, efficient, and dynamic user interfaces.</li>
            <li><strong>Responsive Design:</strong> Ensuring your site looks great on any device, from desktop to mobile.</li>
          </ul>
          <h2>How I Can Help Your Business</h2>
          <p>Whether you’re a small local business looking to create an online presence or a large global company wanting to enhance your website’s functionality, I am here to help. I don’t just build websites, I create digital experiences that help your business succeed. Here's how I can support you:</p>
          <ul>

            <li><strong>Mobile-First Approach:</strong> Your website will be fully optimized for mobile devices, ensuring a seamless experience for your customers, no matter how they access your site</li>
